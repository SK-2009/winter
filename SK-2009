# Project Name
Mini Security Camera
## Summary

What I plan on building is a small camera in a 3D printed enclosure that I can place anywhere with a adhesive bottom and go unnoticed for a long time

## Plan

Create a small enclosure on tinkercad that has space for all the components, Put it all together and maybe make multiple for around my house. I already have a 3D printer and the tools to complete the other parts required for this project.
